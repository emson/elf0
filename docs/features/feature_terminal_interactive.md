# Terminal Interactive Input Feature

## Overview
Implement clean terminal handoff for interactive input collection, allowing users to see cursor and real-time character input while maintaining spinner functionality.

## Problem Statement
Current implementation has terminal control conflicts between Rich Live (spinner) and input collection systems, resulting in poor UX where users can't see their cursor or characters appearing in real-time.

## Solution
Complete terminal handoff approach - pause Rich Live display during input collection, resume after completion.

## Implementation Tasks

### Core Components
- [x] **Terminal State Management** - Enhanced existing input state module
- [x] **Spinner Pause/Resume** - Added pause/resume capability to progress_spinner
- [x] **Clean Input Collection** - Ensured input system gets exclusive terminal control
- [x] **State Coordination** - Coordinated between spinner and input systems

### Implementation Checklist

#### Phase 1: Enhanced Progress Spinner
- [x] Modify `progress_spinner` in `src/elf0/cli.py` to support pause/resume
- [x] Add background monitoring of input collection state
- [x] Use Rich Live's `stop()` and `start()` methods for clean transitions
- [x] Implement proper cleanup and error handling

#### Phase 2: Input Collection Enhancement
- [x] Update `get_user_input()` in `src/elf0/functions/utils.py` for proper signaling
- [x] Ensure `set_collecting_input()` called at start
- [x] Ensure `clear_collecting_input()` called at end (try/finally)
- [x] Remove competing terminal output during input collection

#### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
- [x] Test basic interactive workflow functionality
- [x] Verify cursor visibility and real-time typing
- [x] Test error handling and cleanup
- [x] Validate no regression in existing functionality

## Technical Requirements

### Minimal Implementation
- Use existing `input_state` module for communication
- Leverage Rich Live's built-in `stop()` and `start()` methods
- Background thread monitoring for responsive state changes
- Clean separation of concerns

### Success Criteria
- [x] Users see cursor during input collection
- [x] Characters appear in real-time as typed
- [x] Spinner pauses during input, resumes after
- [x] No terminal control conflicts
- [x] All existing functionality preserved

## Files Modified
- `src/elf0/cli.py` - Enhanced progress_spinner
- `src/elf0/functions/utils.py` - Clean input collection
- `src/elf0/core/input_state.py` - Already exists, no changes needed

## Expected User Experience
```
â ‹ Running workflow...
Assistant:
What is your name?

> prasadâ–ˆ                    # Cursor visible, real-time typing
[Enter pressed]
â ‹ Running workflow...        # Spinner resumes
[Final result]
```

## Implementation Summary

### Completed Features
âœ… **Complete terminal handoff solution implemented**
- Clean pause/resume of Rich Live spinner during input collection
- Background thread monitoring for responsive state changes
- Proper terminal control handoff using existing input state module
- Users now see cursor and real-time character input
- No terminal control conflicts
- All existing functionality preserved

### Architecture
- **Minimal code changes**: Used existing `input_state` module for communication
- **Clean separation**: Spinner and input systems coordinate via shared state
- **Robust error handling**: Proper cleanup and exception handling
- **Thread-safe**: Background monitoring with proper thread management

### Testing Results
- âœ… Basic interactive workflow functionality working
