    # Step 1: Analyze improvement request
    - id: improvement_analyzer
      kind: agent
      ref: anthropic_sonnet
      config:
        prompt: |
          Analyze this request for improving the ELF platform:
          
          Request: {input}
          
          Please identify:
          1. Which ELF components need modification
          2. What new capabilities should be added
          3. Technical approach for implementation
          4. Files that need to be modified or created
          5. Testing requirements
          
          Focus on improvements that enhance ELF's workflow orchestration, agent patterns, or self-improvement capabilities.

    # Step 2: Generate implementation using Claude Code
    - id: implementation_generator
      kind: claude_code
      config:
        task: "generate_code"
        prompt: |
          Implement the ELF platform improvements based on this analysis:
          
          ${state.output}
          
          Please:
          1. Generate Python code following ELF's architecture patterns
          2. Create new node types, workflow patterns, or utilities as needed
          3. Follow ELF's coding standards (see CLAUDE.md)
          4. Add proper type hints and documentation
          5. Create example workflows demonstrating the new capabilities
          
          Ensure all code integrates seamlessly with ELF's existing architecture.

    # Step 3: Review and optimize the implementation
    - id: code_reviewer
      kind: claude_code
      config:
        task: "analyze_code"
        prompt: |
          Review this ELF platform improvement implementation:
          
          ${state.output}
          
          Check for:
          1. Compliance with ELF's architecture patterns
          2. Proper error handling and logging
          3. Integration with existing components
          4. Code quality and maintainability
          5. Security considerations
          6. Performance implications
          
          Suggest specific improvements for production readiness.

    # Step 4: Create improved implementation
    - id: final_implementation
      kind: claude_code
      config:
        task: "modify_code"
        prompt: |
          Create the final, production-ready implementation incorporating this review:
          
          Review: {output}
          
          Please:
          1. Apply all recommended improvements
          2. Ensure robust error handling
          3. Add comprehensive logging
          4. Include unit tests following ELF's testing patterns
          5. Create documentation and examples
          
          The result should be ready for integration into ELF.

    # Step 5: Generate integration summary
    - id: integration_summary
      kind: agent
      ref: anthropic_sonnet
      config:
        prompt: |
          Create an integration summary for this ELF platform improvement:
          
          Original Request: {input}
          Final Implementation: {output}
          
          Provide:
          1. Overview of new capabilities added
          2. Files created or modified
          3. Integration instructions
          4. Testing checklist
          5. Documentation updates needed
          6. Example usage scenarios
          
          This summary should help the development team integrate the improvements.
