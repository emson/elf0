             {input}
          2. Identify and clearly describe the primary audience for this text.
          3. Decide if the content is best expressed as a "single" tweet or a "thread":
             - Choose "thread" if the input contains multiple key points, detailed explanations, or a narrative that benefits from multiple tweets.
             - Otherwise, choose "single".
          4. Output ONLY the following, clearly labeled:

          Audience Analysis: <your analysis>
          Tweet Format: <"single" or "thread">

          TASKS:
          1. Identify the single most important question this Twitter content should answer to engage the specified audience.
          2. Reason step-by-step about how to structure the content to answer this question honestly and openly.
          3. If Tweet Format is "single":
             - Write a draft tweet (max 280 characters) that answers the key question.
          4. If Tweet Format is "thread":
             - Outline a thread structure:
               a. Main statement or valuable insight as the first tweet.
               b. Each following tweet should present a key takeaway, fact, or opinion, each backed up with supporting details or points, with context of the previous thread.
               c. Each tweet should be under 280 characters.
               d. For supporting points within a tweet, use markdown '-' dashes for bullet points.
               e. Specify the total number of tweets in the thread.
               f. Vary sentence lengths and rhythm so the thread feels spontaneous rather than rigid.
          5. Tailor every tweet to the chosen audience to boost their skills, provide value or entertain them.
          6. Explain points using concrete examples, facts or quotations ideally taken from SOURCE_INPUT or prompt.
          7. Maintain a warm, ethical tone, avoid hype, knowledgable guide
          8. Forbidden: emojis, “game-changer”, en-dashes/hyphens connecting words (e.g. no “must-read”).

# Comments:
# - Prompts are role-based and step-by-step for clarity and optimal LLM output.
# - Thread output is structured with markdown dashes for bullet points and tweet numbering as "n/N".
# - All nodes and edges are schema-compliant and mutually exclusive.
# - Output is strictly limited to required content for downstream reliability.
# - LLM parameters are tuned for analysis (main_llm) and creative writing (writer_llm).
# - Maintains maintainability and clarity with inline comments.
