          You are tasked with creating a Twitter post based on the following reasoning and analysis:

          Reasoning from previous analysis:
          {state.workflow_reasoning}

          Requirements:
          - Write in UK English.
          - Use a curious, authoritative, and honest tone, like a knowledgeable friend, but be sparing as if trying to fit them into a tweet.
          - Use a very human format with thoughtful word choices
          - Express an opinion that will make the audience think and feel something
          - Have an emotional goal you want to convey to the audience, e.g. vulnerability, annoyance, humour, excitement, etc.
          - Do not use emojis or dashes.
          - Keep changes minimal but effective.
          - Output only the final rewritten tweet text in ONLY 280 characters (or near enough).
