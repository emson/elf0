runtime: "langgraph" # Specifies the execution engine

llms:
  # Define the LLM client configuration to be used by agent nodes
  # The 'ref' in the nodes will point to 'default_chat_llm'
  default_chat_llm:
    _type: "openai_chat"  # Placeholder: actual type depends on LLMClient implementation
    model_name: "gpt-4.1-mini" # Corrected field name, was 'model'
    temperature: 0.7
    # A system message could be part of the LLM config if always applicable
    # system_message: "You are an expert content creator."

workflow:
  _type: sequential # Indicates nodes process data in sequence
  nodes:
    - id: outline_generator
      kind: agent         # This node is an LLM-powered agent
      ref: default_chat_llm # Uses the LLM configuration defined above
      config:
        # The prompt template for this node.
        # It's assumed that {input} will be replaced with the initial user prompt.
        prompt: |
          Topic: {input}

          Based on the topic provided above, please generate a comprehensive and well-structured outline.
          The outline should clearly delineate:
          1. Main sections with descriptive headings.
          2. Key sub-points or arguments under each main section.
          3. A logical progression of ideas from introduction to conclusion.

          The output should consist solely of the generated outline text.
      # No 'stop: true' here, as it's not the final node

    - id: linkedin_post_refiner
      kind: agent
      ref: default_chat_llm
      config:
        # This prompt template will use the output of the 'outline_generator'.
        # It's assumed that {output} will be replaced with state['output'] from the previous node.
        prompt: |
          Original Outline:
          {output}

          Transform the above outline into a polished, engaging, and professional LinkedIn post.
          The post should:
          - Adopt a natural and human-like tone.
          - Be suitable for a professional LinkedIn audience.
          - Encourage engagement (e.g., by posing a thoughtful question or a call to discussion).
          - Be well-structured and easy to read (consider using short paragraphs, bullet points if appropriate).
          - Include 2-3 relevant hashtags.

          The output should consist solely of the LinkedIn post content.
      stop: true # Marks this as the final node in the workflow
